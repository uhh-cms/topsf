#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Script that installs, removes and / or sources an environment containing the HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit
# tool, a.k.a. `combine`. Distinctions are made depending on whether the installation is already present,
# and whether the script is called as part of a remote (law) job (CF_REMOTE_JOB=1).
#
# Six environment variables are expected to be set before this script is called:
#   CF_SANDBOX_FILE
#       The path of the file that contained the sandbox definition and that sourced _this_ script.
#       It is used to derive a hash for defining the installation directory and to set the value of
#       the LAW_SANDBOX variable.
#   CF_COMBINE_GIT_URL
#       A URL pointing to a combine Git repository.
#   CF_COMBINE_VERSION
#       The desired version of combine to set up (must be a valid revision in the combine Git repository).
#   CF_COMBINE_BASE
#       The location where the environment containing combine should be installed.
#   CF_COMBINE_ENV_NAME
#       The name of the environment to prevent collisions between multiple environments using the
#       same version of combine.
#   CF_COMBINE_FLAG
#       An incremental integer value stored in the installed combine environment to detect whether it
#       needs to be updated.
#
# Arguments:
#   1. mode
#      The setup mode. Different values are accepted:
#        - ''/install: The combine environment is installed when not existing yet and sourced.
#        - clear:      The combine environment is removed when existing.
#        - reinstall:  The combine environment is removed first, then reinstalled and sourced.
#        - update:     The combine environment is removed first in case it is outdated, then
#                      reinstalled and sourced.
#      Please note that if the mode is empty ('') and the environment variable CF_SANDBOX_SETUP_MODE
#      is defined, its value is used instead.
#
# Note on remote jobs:
# When the CF_REMOTE_JOB variable is found to be "1" (usually set by a remote job bootstrap script),
# no mode is supported and no installation will happen but the desired combine setup is reused from a
# pre-compiled combine bundle that is fetched from a local or remote location and unpacked.
